## Getting Started

Once you have Jekyll up-and-running, there are only a few steps needed to make this theme your own:

1. Fill out the `_config.yml` to configure global variable. For the first use you can just replace __Site Title__, __Your description__, __/Mysite__ and __Your name__.
2. Create collections needed (see below HOW to create new collection).
3. Replace jekyll_path variable to your custom folder in script/* shell files.
4. Create new_yourCollection.sh file in order to accelarete the creation of new post.
5. Start writing posts in your collections.

## How to change website name:
- In _config.yml: change << baseurl : "/Mysite" >> by << baseurl : "/Newname" >> 
- In script/launch.sh: change << google-chrome --app=http://127.0.0.1:4000/Mysite/index
 >> by << google-chrome --app=http://127.0.0.1:4000/Newname/index
>>
- In script/download.sh: change << http://localhost:4000/Mysite/ >> by << http://localhost:4000/Newname/
>>


## How to create a new collection:
- Look to existing collection and just copy paste everything.
- Be caution about your html class definition, if you change the name of the class="class_name", the renering will probably not be defined in the assets/main.css file.
